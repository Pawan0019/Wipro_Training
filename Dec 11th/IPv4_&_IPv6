# IPv4 and IPv6

The **Internet Protocol (IP)** assigns a unique address to every device on a network so it can send and receive data over the internet. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)

**IPv4** is the 4th version of the Internet Protocol. It is used to identify devices on a network using a **32-bit addressing system**.

---

### Key Features of IPv4

- Uses **32-bit addresses**
- Supports approximately **4.3 billion unique addresses**
- Written in **dot-decimal notation** (four numbers separated by dots)
- Most widely used IP version today
- Address space is nearly exhausted

**Example:**
192.168.1.1

---

### Limitations of IPv4

- **Limited Address Space**  
  32-bit addressing cannot support the growing number of internet-connected devices.

- **Complex Setup**  
  Requires manual configuration or DHCP, which can be error-prone.

- **Inefficient Routing**  
  Larger and complex headers slow down packet processing.

- **Weak Security**  
  No built-in security features; requires additional mechanisms.

- **Poor QoS Support**  
  Limited ability to prioritize traffic, affecting voice and video quality.

- **Packet Fragmentation**  
  Routers may split packets, causing inefficiency and possible data loss.

- **Broadcast Overhead**  
  Uses broadcasting, increasing unnecessary network traffic.

## IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)

**IPv6** is the newest version of the Internet Protocol, designed to replace IPv4 and solve the problem of IP address exhaustion.  
It uses a much larger **128-bit addressing system**.

---

### Key Features of IPv6

- Uses **128-bit addresses**
- Supports **340 undecillion** addresses  
  *(340 trillion trillion trillion unique addresses)*
- Written in **hexadecimal format**, separated by colons
- More secure and efficient than IPv4
- Designed for future scalability

**Example:**
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

---

## Why IPv6 Was Developed

- To solve the **IP address shortage**
- To enable **faster and simpler routing**
- To improve **security** with built-in encryption
- To support the rapid growth of:
  - Mobile phones
  - Smart home devices (IoT)
  - Servers and cloud systems

---

## IPv4 vs IPv6 (Summary)

- **IPv4**
  - 32-bit addressing
  - ~4 billion addresses
  - Addresses almost exhausted

- **IPv6**
  - 128-bit addressing
  - Virtually unlimited addresses
  - Designed for the future of the internet

---

IPv6 ensures the internet can continue to grow and support billions of new devices efficiently and securely.
