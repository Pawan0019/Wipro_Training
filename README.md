# Wipro_Training

This repository contains my **daily training work from the Wipro training program**.  
It includes **theory notes, assignments, diagrams, and hands-on coding practice**, organized **date-wise** to reflect the day-to-day learning progression during training.

The repository primarily focuses on:
- Core **Computer Science fundamentals**
- **C# programming** concepts and assignments
- **Software Engineering** and **SDLC**
- **Computer Networks**
- Practical problem-solving through code

## 🧠 Theory & Documentation Content

Several folders contain **Markdown (`.md`) notes and diagrams** related to foundational topics, including:

### Computer Networks
- Computer Networks overview
- IPv4 and IPv6
- Subnetting
- NAT (Network Address Translation)

### Software Engineering
- SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
- SDLC Phases and Models
- Conceptual diagrams and illustrations
- Written assignments and reflections

These files are documented in **Markdown format** for clarity and easy readability.

## 💻 Programming Practice (C#)

The repository includes **C# source files (`.cs`)** demonstrating hands-on practice of programming concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Constructors
- Methods and Properties
- Console-based programs
- Assignment-based problem solving

### Example Topics Covered
- Calculator applications
- Student management classes
- Inheritance-based assignments
- Program structure using `Main()` and supporting classes

All programs are written as part of **training exercises and assessments**.
