# Computer Networks – Day 1

A **computer network** is a system that connects multiple independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other devices allows users to communicate more easily.  
It is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 1. Personal Area Network (PAN)

A **Personal Area Network (PAN)** is the most basic type of computer network.  
It is designed to connect devices within a very short range, typically around one person.

- Connects personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearables  
- Network range: **1 to 10 meters**  
- Very high transmission speed  
- Easy maintenance and very low cost  

### Examples
- Bluetooth headphones  
- Smartwatch connected to a phone  
- Wireless keyboard and mouse  
- Mobile hotspot between phone and laptop

## 2. Local Area Network (LAN)

A **Local Area Network (LAN)** connects computers through a common communication path within a limited geographical area.

- Most frequently used network type  
- Covers homes, offices, and schools  
- Uses **Ethernet** and **Wi-Fi** technologies  
- Range: up to **2 km**  
- High transmission speed  
- Low cost and easy maintenance  

### Examples
- Home Wi-Fi network  
- Office computer network  
- School computer labs

## 3. Campus Area Network (CAN)

A **Campus Area Network (CAN)** is larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN.

- Used in schools, colleges, hospitals, and corporate campuses  
- Covers multiple buildings within a campus  
- Mainly uses Ethernet technology  
- Range: a few kilometers  
- High transmission speed  
- Moderate cost and maintenance  

### Examples
- University campuses  
- Corporate office complexes  
- Hospital networks

## 4. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

- Covers a city, town, or metropolitan area  
- Uses technologies like **FDDI, CDDI, and ATM**  
- Range: **5 km to 50 km**  
- Average transmission speed  
- Difficult to maintain  
- High cost  

### Examples
- City-wide fiber networks  
- Cable TV networks  
- Interconnected university campuses

## 5. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

A **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)** acts like a LAN but uses wireless technology.

- Uses **Wi-Fi** instead of physical cables  
- Allows devices to communicate wirelessly  

### Examples
- Wi-Fi routers in homes  
- Public Wi-Fi in airports, malls, and cafés

## 6. Wide Area Network (WAN)

A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** connects computers over a very large geographical distance.

- Covers multiple cities, countries, or continents  
- Connects multiple LANs together  
- Range: **greater than 50 km**  
- Uses **Leased Lines** and **Dial-up** technology  
- Low transmission speed  
- Very high cost and maintenance  

### Examples
- The Internet  
- Multinational company networks  
- Long-distance leased lines

## 7. System Area Network (SAN)

A **System Area Network (SAN)** is designed for high-performance computing environments.

- Used in data centers and supercomputing facilities  
- Provides access to **block-level data storage**  
- Extremely high speed and reliability  

### Examples
- Data centers  
- Cloud servers  
- Enterprise backup systems
