# Network Address Translation (NAT)

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a networking technique that allows multiple devices within a private network to access external networks (like the Internet) using a single public IP address. By translating private IP addresses into public IP addresses and vice versa, NAT conserves the limited pool of IPv4 addresses and adds a layer of security by masking internal addresses from the outside world. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
