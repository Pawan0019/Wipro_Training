# What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative and incremental SDLC model where the project is divided into small cycles called sprints (1–4 weeks).  
It focuses on continuous improvement, customer feedback, and flexibility to change requirements.

---

## Agile Process Steps (Sprint Cycle)

### 1. Requirement Gathering

Requirements are collected at a high level.  

Detailed requirements emerge during each sprint.

### 2. Sprint Planning

Team selects user stories from the backlog.  

Sprint goals and tasks are defined.

### 3. Design

Lightweight design created for selected features.  

May include UI mockups or simple diagrams.

### 4. Development

Features are developed in small increments.  

Coding starts immediately.

### 5. Testing

Continuous testing within each sprint.  

Bugs are fixed quickly.

### 6. Review / Sprint Demo

Team demonstrates completed features to client.  

Feedback is collected.

### 7. Retrospective

Team discusses what went well and what can improve.

### 8. Deployment

After every sprint, or after several sprints.

# 2️⃣ Waterfall Model

---

## 📌 What is Waterfall?

Waterfall is a linear and sequential SDLC model where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.  
It is simple but rigid since changes are difficult once development starts.

---

## 🔹 Steps in Waterfall Model

### 1. Requirements

Complete and detailed documentation.  

No changes expected later.

### 2. System Design

Architecture, database design, UI design.

### 3. Implementation (Coding)

Developers write code based on design.

### 4. Integration & Testing

All modules are integrated.  

System testing, bug fixing.

### 5. Deployment

Software released to users.

### 6. Maintenance

Updates, patches, customer support.

# 3️⃣ V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)

---

## 📌 What is the V-Model?

The V-Model is an extension of the Waterfall model.  
For each development phase, a corresponding testing phase exists.  

Development goes down the left side of the “V” and testing moves up the right side.

---

## 🔹 Steps in V-Model

### Left Side (Verification Phases)

#### 1. Requirements Analysis

User requirements defined.  

Corresponding test: Acceptance Test Planning

#### 2. System Design

System architecture planned.  

Corresponding test: System Test Planning

#### 3. High-Level Design (HLD)

Modules are defined.  

Corresponding test: Integration Test Planning

#### 4. Low-Level Design (LLD)

Module logic, algorithms defined.  

Corresponding test: Unit Test Planning

#### 5. Coding

Developers write code for all modules.

---

### Right Side (Validation Phases)

#### 6. Unit Testing

Tests individual components based on LLD.

#### 7. Integration Testing

Tests module interactions based on HLD.

#### 8. System Testing

Tests complete system based on system design.

#### 9. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Validates system against user requirements.

# 4️⃣ Spiral Model

---

## 📌 What is the Spiral Model?

The Spiral Model is risk-driven and iterative.  

Each cycle of development is called a spiral, and every spiral includes planning, risk evaluation, development, and review.

It is ideal for large, complex, and high-risk projects.

---

## 🔹 Steps in Spiral Model (Each Spiral)

### 1. Planning

Define objectives, alternatives, constraints.  

Initial requirements gathered.

### 2. Risk Analysis

Identify and analyze risks (technical, cost, time).  

Create prototypes to reduce risks.

### 3. Engineering / Development

Actual development and testing.  

May include coding, testing, and design.

### 4. Evaluation / Customer Review

Customer reviews outcomes.  

Feedback is used for next spiral.

After evaluation → Next Spiral Begins  

Each spiral leads to refined requirements and better understanding.
