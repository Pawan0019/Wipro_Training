# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured framework used by software organizations to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain high-quality software. It defines the complete process of software production, from the initial idea to the final deployment and maintenance.

The goal of the SDLC is to produce high-quality software that:
- Meets or exceeds customer expectations
- Is completed within time and cost estimates
- Is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain

## Why is SDLC Important?

Without a structured SDLC, software development can become chaotic. Teams may miss requirements, exceed budgets, or deliver buggy software that does not solve user problems.

SDLC provides:
- **Visibility** – Stakeholders know what is happening at every stage
- **Quality Control** – Testing is integrated into the process
- **Risk Management** – Potential issues are identified early
- **Cost Estimation** – Helps predict timelines and budgets accurately

## Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle

SDLC defines a sequence of stages that guide software engineers throughout the development process. Each stage has specific objectives, activities, and deliverables.

---

## Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis

This is the most fundamental stage. Before writing any code, the team must define what they are building and why.

**Activities**
- Feasibility studies (technical, operational, economic)
- Resource allocation
- Project scheduling
- Cost estimation

**Output**
- Project Plan  
- Feasibility Report  

**Key Players**
- Senior Engineers  
- Project Managers  
- Stakeholders

## Stage 2: Defining Requirements (SRS)

Once planning is approved, detailed product requirements are documented in the **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**.

**Activities**
- Gathering functional requirements
- Gathering non-functional requirements
- Requirement validation

**Output**
- SRS Document (reference guide for the development team)

**Key Players**
- Business Analysts  
- Product Owners

## Stage 3: Designing Architecture

In this phase, requirements are converted into a technical blueprint that defines the system architecture and technology stack.

### High-Level Design (HLD)
- System architecture
- Database design
- Relationships between modules

### Low-Level Design (LLD)
- Component logic
- API interfaces
- Database tables

**Output**
- Design Document Specification (DDS)

**Key Players**
- System Architects  
- Lead Developers

## Stage 4: Development (Coding)

This is the longest phase where the actual software is built.

**Activities**
- Coding
- Code reviews
- Unit testing
- Static code analysis

**Tools**
- IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Compilers and debuggers
- Version control systems (Git)

**Output**
- Source code
- Executable software

**Key Players**
- Frontend Developers  
- Backend Developers  
- Full-Stack Developers

## Stage 5: Testing

After development, the software is tested to ensure quality and reliability.

**Types of Testing**
- **Unit Testing** – Testing individual components
- **Integration Testing** – Verifying module interactions
- **System Testing** – Testing the complete application
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Business validation

**Output**
- Test cases
- Bug reports
- Quality assurance reports

**Key Players**
- QA Engineers  
- Testers

## Stage 6: Deployment

The software is released to end users. In modern systems, deployment is often automated using CI/CD pipelines.

**Activities**
- Production environment setup
- Application deployment
- Smoke testing

**Output**
- Live application

**Key Players**
- DevOps Engineers  
- Release Managers

---

## Stage 7: Maintenance

SDLC continues after deployment to keep the software useful and up to date.

**Activities**
- Bug fixing
- Performance tuning
- Library and dependency upgrades
- Feature enhancements

**Output**
- Patches
- Updates
- New versions

**Key Players**
- Support Engineers  
- Developers

## Software Development Life Cycle Models

Software Development Models define how the SDLC stages are executed.

Common SDLC models include:
- Waterfall Model
- Agile Model
- Spiral Model
- V-Model
- Incremental Model

Each model is chosen based on project requirements, complexity, and risk.
