# What is Kanban Board?

A Kanban Board is a visual tool used to manage and optimize workflow in various industries, including software development, project management, and manufacturing. The Kanban method has evolved into an agile project management approach, emphasizing continuous improvement and efficiency.

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that helps teams manage workflow, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency across projects.

Boards use cards, columns, and WIP limits to visualize tasks and identify bottlenecks in real time.

Kanban boards can be physical or digital, and are adaptable to various team processes and contexts.

Set up a kanban board with clear columns and WIP limits to streamline your team’s workflow and boost productivity.

Kanban Board is a brilliant visual tool that gives an overview of the current work status and simplifies team communication.

It's also a key element in the Kanban method, which helps to optimize and continuously improve any business process. Visualizing work on a kanban board will boost productivity and eliminate chaos from your workplace.

## Elements of Kanban Board
![Elements](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240208182153/Elements-of-Kanban-Board.webp)

### Columns

**Definition:**  
Columns represent different stages or steps in the workflow.

**Functionality:**  
Each column signifies a specific phase that a task or work item goes through. Common column names include "To Do," "In Progress," "Testing," and "Done."

**Purpose:**  
Columns provide a structured visual representation of the work stages, allowing team members to quickly understand where tasks are in the process.

---

### Task Cards

**Definition:**  
Task cards are individual cards or sticky notes representing specific work items.

**Functionality:**  
Each task card contains information about a particular task, including a brief description, assignee, due date, and any other relevant details.

**Purpose:**  
Task cards make the work tangible and provide a concise overview of the tasks being managed. They move across columns as tasks progress through the workflow.

---

### Work in Progress (WIP) Limits

**Definition:**  
WIP limits are constraints set on the maximum number of tasks allowed in a particular column at any given time.

**Functionality:**  
WIP limits prevent work overload in specific stages of the workflow, promoting a balanced and efficient flow.

**Purpose:**  
By limiting the number of tasks in progress, teams can maintain focus, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the flow of work.

---

### Swimlanes

**Definition:**  
Swimlanes are horizontal or vertical partitions within the Kanban Board.

**Functionality:**  
Swimlanes categorize tasks based on specific criteria such as priority, team, or type of work. This allows for additional visual organization.
Purpose: 

**Purpose:**  
Swimlanes help teams prioritize tasks, allocate work to specific team members, or distinguish between different types of work within the same board.

---

### Labels or Color Coding

**Definition:**  
Labels or color coding involves using distinct colors or labels to categorize tasks or denote specific attributes.

**Functionality:**  
Different colors or labels can represent task types, priority levels, or any custom classification chosen by the team.

**Purpose:**  
Labels enhance visual clarity and help teams quickly identify and understand task characteristics or priorities.

---

### Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)

**Definition:**  
A Cumulative Flow Diagram is a graphical representation of the flow of tasks over time.

**Functionality:**  
It shows the number of tasks in each column at various points, helping teams analyze trends, identify patterns, and understand workflow dynamics.

**Purpose:**  
CFDs provide valuable insights into workflow efficiency, allowing teams to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions.

---

### Blocked or Impediment Indicators

**Definition:**  
Indicators or markers that highlight tasks facing obstacles or impediments.

**Functionality:**  
Blocked indicators draw attention to tasks that are stuck or facing challenges, prompting teams to address issues and keep the workflow moving.

**Purpose:**  
Identifying and resolving impediments promptly is crucial for maintaining a smooth and efficient workflow.

## How does a Kanban Board work?
Kanban Boards map individual work items to cards placed into columns on a board. Columns represent the value stream — the sequence of steps work must pass through from start to finish.

Different card colors represent different types of work. Swimlanes organize teams working on the same board. WIP limits ensure smooth flow, and team members pull cards from left to right as work progresses.

## How to create a Kanban Board explained in 5 easy steps

### Step 1: Visualize your workflow

To create a Kanban Board, get a whiteboard, then break down the flow of work from the moment you start it to when it's finished into distinctive steps and draw a column for each.

---

### Step 2: Identify the types of work you do

Decide what kinds of work items you are usually working on. These may be, for example, customer orders, support requests, or maintenance tasks. Assign a distinctive color to each of them, and get a bunch of sticky notes in these colors.

---

### Step 3: Write down tasks on cards and place them on the board

Write down each thing you are working on on a separate color-coded sticky note, and put it onto the board into the respective column. The order of cards in each column should represent their relative priority, with the most urgent ones at the top.

---

### Step 4: Start working with your Kanban board

Work on tasks starting with the ones at the top. When a task is ready to be moved to the next column, place it at its bottom. Such a method of working will help to maintain a high flow of work on your board.

---

### Step 5: Improve the flow of work

Kanban is all about maintaining a high and consistent flow of work. With your board, you should be able to see the overview of work status and instantly identify any problems or bottlenecks. No work item should lag behind, and columns should not be overloaded with tasks. The most straightforward technique to ensure consistent flow is limiting work in progress.
