# Unix History

The Unix operating system got its start in 1969 at Bell Laboratories and was written in assembly language. In 1973, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie succeeded in rewriting Unix in their new language C. This was quite an audacious move; at the time, system programming was done in assembly in order to extract maximum performance from the hardware. The concept of a portable operating system was barely a gleam in anyone's eye.

The creation of a portable operating system was very significant in the computing industry, but then came the problem of licensing each type of Unix. Richard Stallman, an American software freedom activist and programmer recognized a need for open source solutions and launched the GNU project in 1983, later founding the Free Software Foundation. His goal was to create a completely free and open source operating system that was Unix-compatible or Unix-like.

# Linux History

In 1987, the source code to a minimalistic Unix-like operating system called MINIX was released by Andrew Tanenbaum, a professor at Vrije Universiteit, for academic purposes. Linus Torvalds began developing a new operating system based on MINIX while a student at the University of Helsinki in 1991. In September of 1991, Torvalds released the first version (0.1) of the Linux kernel.

Torvalds greatly enhanced the open source community by releasing the Linux kernel under the GNU General Public License so that everyone has access to the source code and can freely make modifications to it. Many components from the GNU project, such as the GNU Core Utilities, were then integrated with the Linux kernel, thus completing the first free and open source operating system.

Linux has been adapted to a variety of computer systems of many sizes and purposes. Furthermore, different variants of Linux (called Linux distributions) have been developed over time to meet various needs. There are now hundreds of different Linux distributions available, with a wide variety of features. The most popular operating system in the world is actually Android, which is built on the Linux kernel.

# The Philosophy

The primary Principle of Linux is a free software system and its nature of being open supply. It respects users, freedom to Run, Modifies and distribute the source code. Because it is an open-source distribution, it’s very well secured. The “Free Foundation Software” system introduced the term Free software system and the “GNU Foundation” in 1985 by Richard Stallman. In today’s world, the foremost distinguished Open supply software systems are below “GNU GPL,” and the license is formed by “Free Foundation Software” and “GNU Foundation.” The illustrious samples of Open Sources Software are Firefox, Eclipse, and so on.

# Origin of Linux

1980s–early 1990s: Unix was widely used in universities and enterprises, but most Unix systems were proprietary and expensive.

1991: Linus Torvalds, a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, began working on a free Unix-like kernel as a personal project.

He announced it on the comp.os.minix newsgroup, releasing Linux 0.01.

Linux was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute it.

Key point:  
Linux is only the kernel—the core that manages hardware, memory, CPU, and processes.

# Origin of the GNU Project

1983: Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project.

Goal: Create a completely free Unix-like operating system.

GNU stands for “GNU’s Not Unix” (a recursive acronym).

By the late 1980s, GNU had developed:

- Compilers (GCC)
- Shell (Bash)
- Core utilities (ls, cp, mv, grep, etc.)
- Libraries

Missing piece: A working kernel (the GNU kernel, Hurd, was incomplete).

# Birth of GNU/Linux

When Linux (kernel) became available in 1991, it perfectly filled GNU’s missing gap.

Developers combined:

- Linux kernel + GNU tools and libraries

This formed a complete free operating system.

Technically correct name: GNU/Linux  
Commonly used name: Linux

# Why the Name “GNU/Linux” Matters

| Term | Meaning |
|-----|--------|
| Linux | The kernel only |
| GNU | Tools, compilers, shell, libraries |
| GNU/Linux | Complete operating system |

Richard Stallman emphasizes GNU/Linux to acknowledge GNU’s foundational role, while most users casually say Linux.

# Timeline Summary

- 1983 – GNU Project started (Richard Stallman)
- 1989 – GNU GPL released
- 1991 – Linux kernel created (Linus Torvalds)
- 1992 – Linux + GNU tools → GNU/Linux OS

# Real-World Impact

Today, GNU/Linux powers:

- Servers and cloud platforms
- Supercomputers
- DevOps & AI/ML systems
- Android (Linux kernel-based)
- Embedded and IoT devices
