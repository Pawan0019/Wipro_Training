# Meetings in Agile Methodology
Agile meetings, also called Scrum ceremonies, are an essential part of the Agile framework, an iterative approach to project management. In this framework, team members deliver products incrementally, after brief periods or sprints, rather than all at once. Agile meetings occur at key points throughout a sprint cycle and allow the development team to announce progress updates, plan tasks, discuss client feedback and share other important project information. Though the Agile method originated in the software development industry, its guidelines can help teams in many fields complete projects efficiently.

## What are the 4 Agile Ceremonies?
The four key ceremonies in Agile are:
- Sprint Planning  
- Daily Standup (or Daily Scrum)  
- Sprint Review  
- Sprint Retrospective

## 1. Sprint Planning
This ceremony occurs at the beginning of each sprint, which is typically a two-to-four-week time frame. The goal is to plan and agree on the work that the team will complete during the sprint. The Product Owner presents the highest-priority items from the product backlog, and the team discusses and estimates the effort required to complete each item. The team then commits to completing a set of tasks, creating a sprint backlog.

### Purpose of Sprint Planning
The Sprint Planning ceremony sets the stage for the upcoming sprint. The Product Owner presents the highest-priority items from the product backlog, and the team discusses and estimates the effort required to complete each item. The team then commits to completing a set of tasks, creating a sprint backlog.
