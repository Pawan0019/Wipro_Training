# Case Study: Implementation of SDLC Phases in a Real-World Engineering Project

## Project: Smart Parking Management System for a Metropolitan City

---

## 1. Introduction

The Smart Parking Management System (SPMS) was developed to address rising congestion in a metropolitan area. The system uses IoT sensors, mobile apps, and cloud-based data processing to help drivers locate available parking spaces in real time.

To ensure reliability and efficiency, the engineering team followed the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This case study evaluates how each SDLC phase contributed to the project’s success.
